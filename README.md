## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
body {
        background-image: url('images/pattern-background-desktop.svg');
        background-size: cover;
        background-position: 50% 20%;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
    };
```
### Continued development

I would like to focus more on backend development before progressing to full stack development.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me position the background image.
- [Modern CSS Master the Key Concepts of CSS for Modern Web Development by Joe Attardi](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-6294-8) - This is an amazing book which helped me finally understand the flexbox layout. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
